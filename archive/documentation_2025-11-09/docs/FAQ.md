## Using the Tools

### Matchmaker isn't giving good results. What should I do?

Try:
- Being more specific about your usage (select multiple use cases)
- Adjusting your budget range
- Relaxing some preferences
- Using Explorer with filters instead

### How do I compare more than 4 laptops?

Versus currently supports up to 4 laptops for clarity. For more:
- Do multiple comparisons (e.g., 3 models vs 3 others)

### Camera Tech didn't identify my laptop. Why?

Common reasons:
- Photo is blurry or too dark
- Logo/model stickers not visible
- Very new or rare model not in our database
- Extreme angle or obstruction

Try taking a clearer photo or manually search in Explorer.

### Can I chat with AI in Bahasa Malaysia?

Currently, AI Command responds in Manglish (mix of English and Malay). Full Bahasa Malaysia support is planned for Phase 2 (Q2 2025).

## 📚 Understanding Your GitHub Situation

You asked: *"I have 18 branches and 100+ commits, how do I organize?"*

**Answer:** Read this file first:
```
/home/user/aibradaa/docs/GITHUB_GUIDE_FOR_BEGINNERS.md
```

This guide explains:
- ✅ What GitHub is (like Google Drive for code)
- ✅ Your current 19 branches (what each one is)
- ✅ How to clean up old branches
- ✅ How to create Pull Requests
- ✅ How to merge to main

## 🗂️ Your Repository After Cleanup

**Right now (before merge):**
```
📦 aibradaa
├── 📂 main (default, needs your Phase 11 work)
├── 🌿 claude/phase-11-... (YOUR WORK HERE, needs to merge → main)
├── 🌿 claude/pricing-audit-... (old, can delete after merge)
└── 🤖 dependabot/* (15 branches, auto-updates, can delete)
```

**After you merge:**
```
📦 aibradaa
├── 📂 main (default, HAS ALL YOUR WORK ✅)
└── 🤖 dependabot/* (optional, can delete these)
```

**Much cleaner!** 🎉
